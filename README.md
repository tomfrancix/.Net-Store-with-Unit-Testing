# .Net-Store-with-Unit-Testing
Some separation of concerns built in as an improvement to the last version

This is a project created with reference to a book.

To get more accustomed to the process of writing tests I revisited this old project.

I have tried to maintain a high degree of separation of concerns throughout.

Using the entity framwork to create the models and the database tables then relate them with DbContext has made much more sense this time around.
